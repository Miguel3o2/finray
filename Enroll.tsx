                  <p className="enrolltext">Community solar makes renewable energy accessible to everyone, regardless of property ownership or roof suitability. Participants share the benefits of a single solar array, often located off-site, allowing them to enjoy reduced electricity costs and support green energy. This inclusive approach helps expand access to solar power, making it a practical option for renters and those who canâ€™t install panels at home.
